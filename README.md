# Stopwatch with Go WebSockets

This project is my initial exploration of Go WebSockets. I developed a dynamic page using Templ and HTMX, with Air for live reloading.

To run the code, you can use Air after obtaining the Air binary:

```bash
air .
```
The server should be listening on localhost:8080.
